# Codeforces Solutions 🚀

</div>

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository contains my **Codeforces problem solutions**.

I solve problems regularly to **strengthen my problem-solving skills**, improve algorithmic thinking, and prepare myself for competitive programming and technical interviews.

Each problem is organized in a separate folder.  
Inside every folder, I include:

- ✅ Problem solution (code)
- 🧠 Fresh explanation of the approach
- ⚙️ Logic breakdown
- 📈 Key learning points

This is not just a solution dump —  
it’s my structured learning archive.
